\*\* The Odin Project's Receipes Project

I am starting this project as the start of many projects with TheOdinProject where I would be learning to become a professional developer who can follow international standards.

This project will first consist of a skeleton website where we will use a main index page which will have links to other receipes. This project will initially use purely HTML untill I am taught more CSS down the line.

This project will mainly demonstrate my HTML skills of using header tags, title, links and paragraphs as well as emphasis and strong.
